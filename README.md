# Treehouse Guestlist

This repository includes an example project from the book 
Hands-on [Rust: Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/).

Build a program designed to assist your security team at a swanky new treehouse. In building this program, 
youâ€™ll learn to accept input from the keyboard, store data in variables, store collections of variables in 
arrays and vectors, and begin to learn the power of Rust iterators and enumerations.
